The Secret Letter

Sarah was cleaning her grandmother's attic when she stumbled upon a small wooden box. Inside it was a yellowed envelope labeled “To the future.”

Curious, Sarah opened it and found a letter from her grandmother, dated 1975. The letter described a hidden spot in their garden where a small key was buried — a key to a box filled with family photos and mementos.

With shaky hands, Sarah followed the instructions in the letter and soon unearthed the box under the old oak tree. Inside were photos of generations past, love letters, and tiny souvenirs — a rich legacy of stories, tying her to a past she hadn’t even known existed.
